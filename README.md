Bernie Sanders challenged Hillary Clinton in the presidential primary elections within the Democratic Party in 2016. The conventional wisdom was that voters who supported Bernie Sanders were more ideologically liberal than those who supported Hillary Clinton. That narrative was complicated by suggestions that Bernie Sanders supporters were also somewhat likely to vote for Donald Trump in the general election.

I'm interested in discerning the relationship between ideology and support for Bernie Sanders. Specifically, do the data from voter polls support the hypothesis that Sanders supporters were more liberal than Clinton supporters? If so, does that characterization hold across demographic subgroups? This document conducts data analysis and a regression model to address this question.

The dataset in is a subset of variables from the American National Election Survey 2016 Pilot Study. The study was conducted by Stanford University and The University of Michigan between January 22 and January 28. The survey sampled 1200 U.S. citizens aged 18 and older from the YouGov panel of opt-in online respondents. A cross-sectional design matched the survey respondents to a nationally representative target voting population based on gender, race, age and education.
